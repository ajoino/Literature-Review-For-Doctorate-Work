					Over the past 15 years, a range of methods have been developed that are able to learn human-like estimates of the semantic relatedness between terms from the way in which these terms are distributed in a corpus of unannotated natural language text.
					These methods have also been evaluated in a number of applications in the cognitive science, computational linguistics and the information retrieval literatures.
					In this paper, we review the available methodologies for derivation of semantic relatedness from free text, as well as their evaluation in a variety of biomedical and other applications. 
					Recent methodological developments, and their applicability to several existing applications are also discussed. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

	This paper is a very general overview of methods in distributional semantics, from a biomedical perspective.
	It is similar to \cite{Turney2010VsmOverview} but it also gives an overview of probabilistic methods and rule-based methods.
	
	The main points are that spatial methods (like vsm) just looks at the distribution of the data and tries to draw conclusions from it.
	Probabilistic methods on the other hand tries to find the 'topics', latent variables that terms and documents are associated with.
	Lastly rule-based methods use some kind of initial knowledge to organize terms and documents, like the way a library does it.
	However, the authors say that the line between these models is often fuzzy.

	The paper then continues with an overview of applications, both general applications and biomedical applications.
	For my work, perhaps the gene clustering and biologica sequence analysis is the most useful ones.
	
	Then new developments like random indexing and incorporation of word order and future trends like incorporation of part-of-speech tags.
	To conclude the paper, some software packages are presented.
	
	I think this paper is very similar to \cite{Turney2010VsmOverview} like I mentioned earlier.
	But as I also mentioned it goes over more method, albeit less detailed.
	Overall this paper did not give me enough new information, but it is by no means a bad paper.
	Once I've learned more about the research problem, I will probably go back to this paper.
